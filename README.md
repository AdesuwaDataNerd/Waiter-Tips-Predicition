# Waiter Tips Prediction with Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting waiter tips using Linear Regression. The model aims to analyze various factors such as service quality, meal cost, and customer feedback to classify waiter tips into categories, providing insights into the factors influencing tip amounts. The project showcases the application of Linear Regression in predicting monetary outcomes in the hospitality industry.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Linear Regression for predicting waiter tips.
- Considers factors such as service quality, meal cost, and time.
- Provides insights into using machine learning for predicting monetary outcomes in hospitality.

## Introduction

In the hospitality industry, understanding and predicting tips can be crucial for both waitstaff and restaurant management. This project employs Logistic Regression to predict waiter tips based on features such as service quality, meal cost, and customer feedback. By classifying tips into categories, the model assists in identifying patterns and factors influencing tip amounts.

### Why Logistic Regression?

Linear Regression, commonly used for binary classification, is adapted in this context to categorize tips into specific ranges. It allows us to model the probability of a tip falling into a particular category based on relevant features. This approach provides interpretability and insights into the relationship between various factors and tip amounts.

### Goals

- Implement Logistic Regression for predicting waiter tips.
- Utilize features such as service quality, meal cost, and customer feedback for classification.
- Evaluate the model's performance using regression metrics.
- Provide practical insights for optimizing service and maximizing tips in the hospitality industry.
